  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A one-pot comfort food stew with a rich, savory broth, and loaded with fresh veggies and tender turkey meatballs.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>⅓ pound 93% lean ground turkey</li>
    <li>¼ cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons fresh bread crumbs</li>
    <li>⅓ large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon minced fresh parsley</li>
    <li>⅓ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>⅓ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>⅙ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>⅙ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>⅓ pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Coat a wire rack with nonstick cooking spray, set on prepared baking sheet, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Combine ground turkey, bread crumbs, egg, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Using a 2-teaspoon cookie scoop, shape the mixture into 1-inch balls and place on the baking rack.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, chicken broth, potatoes, carrots, peas, basil, and red pepper flakes; stir until well combined. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes and carrots are cooked and the broth has somewhat reduced, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in meatballs and simmer until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Season stew with salt and pepper.</li>
  </ol>
